# transformers-summarizer

This is a robust text summarization tool that utilizes advanced BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) models to create concise summaries of lengthy articles or texts. The project incorporates Gradio to provide an interactive web interface, allowing users to either input custom text or upload text files for automatic summarization

**Project Overview**

This project creates a text summarizer using a pre-trained BERT model from Hugging Face's Transformers library. It features an interactive Gradio interface where users can:

- Paste articles for summarization.
- Upload text files.
- Fine-tune the summarization process.

The aim is to help users quickly understand the main points of any text.

**Features**

- Text Summarization: Summarizes long text inputs or uploaded files.
- File Upload: Users can upload text files to be summarized.
- Interactive Interface: Built with Gradio, the app provides an easy-to-use web interface.
- State-of-the-art NLP: Leverages BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for accurate and concise summaries.

**Installation**

***Requirements***
Before running the script, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch: For model deployment.
- Transformers: To load the pre-trained BERT model.
- Gradio: For creating the interactive user interface.
- Install Dependencies

To install the necessary libraries, you can use pip:

pip install torch transformers gradio
